# AI-predictive-maintenance-system-for-solar-
 A Predictive Maintenance System for Solar Panels using Arduino, Python, and Machine Learning (Random Forest).  This project allowed me to bring together hardware and softwareâ€”collecting real-time sensor data, simulating in Proteus, and designing a PCB for deployment. The goal? Detect faults before they happen to improve solar energy reliability.
